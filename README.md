Sharepoint OpenAsset Bootstrap Gallery
======================================
By using a SharePoint XML Viewer web part and calling an OpenAsset album RSS feed, you can create a simple image gallery using the Bootstrap Carousel component.

The caption shows the Project Name by default.

This is currently set to use Bootstrap v2.3.2. Upgrade to Bootstrap 3.3.0 is coming soon.
More information about the Bootstrap v2.3.2 carousel can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel
